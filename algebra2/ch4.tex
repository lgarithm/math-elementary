\section{Field}

\begin{defi}[field]
A \idx{field} is a commutative ring such that every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[prime field]
Let $F$ be a field, the \idx{prime field} of $F$ is the intersection of all subfields of $F$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[character of field]
Let $F$ be a field, the \idx{character} of $F$, $\ch F$ is the number of elements in its prime field
if its prime field is finite, otherwise the character of $F$ is defined as $0$.
\end{defi}

\begin{pro}
Let $F$ be any field, $\ch F$ is either $0$ or prime number.
\end{pro}

\subsection{Field Extension}
Let $E, F$ be fields, $E$ is an extension of $F$ iff $F$ is a subfield of $E$.
The extension usually denoted as $E/F$.

\begin{defi}
Let $E/F$ be an extension of field, a $F$-automorphism of $E$ is an isomorphism
of $E$ which fixes elements in $F$, i.e.
isomorphism $\varphi : E \to E$ such that $\varphi(x) = x \forall x \in F$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Galois group]
Let $E/F$ be an extension of field, the Galois group $\gal_F(E)$ is defined as the
$F$-automorphism of $E$.
\end{defi}

\subsubsection{Adjoin}
For an extension $E/F$ and $a \in E$, $F[x]$ is the smallest subring of $E$
which contains both $F$ and $a$, $F(a)$ is the smallest subfield of $E$ which
contains both $F$ and $a$. Obviously $F[a] \subseteq F(a)$.

Adjoin by multiple elements can be defined in the same way, and denoted by
$F[a_1, \dots, ]$, $F(a_1, \dots, )$

\begin{defi}[simple extension]
An extension $E/F$ is simple iff $E = F(a)$ for some $a \in E$.
\end{defi}
